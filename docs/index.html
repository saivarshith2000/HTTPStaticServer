            <p id="section-header">Why ?</p>
            <p>Computer Networks is one of the courses this semester. But, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was cut
                short
                and some of the stuff we were supposed to learn was not covered. So, I thought "may be I'll learn it
                online
                and see what I can do". This server is result of that thought.

            <p id="section-header">Features</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Static HTTP GET</li>
                <li>Multithreading</li>
                <li>Nothing else</li>

            <p id="section-header">Running</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You'll need a POSIX compliant system, <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>(optional).</li>
                <li><code>clone</code> this repository and run <code>make</code>.</li>
                <li>If you don't have <code>make</code> run <code>gcc -Wall server.c -o server</code> in root directory.
                </li>
                <li>Place your static content in the <code>html/</code> directory or pass your directory name as an
                    argument. In anycase, the static directory must be
                    in the same directory as the <code>server</code> binary.</li>
                <li>Execute the server binary. When you want to stop, type <code>exit</code></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="section">
            <p id="section-header">How does it work ?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <code>main()</code> sets up a listening socket, a threadpool with 8 worker threads (default) and
                    waits for incoming connections using epoll().</li>
                <li>When a new connection arrives, it puts the client socket file descriptor in a queue and sends a
                    signal to the threadpool
                    using the <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> method and forgets about it.</li>
                <li>A free thread from the threadpool dequeues this connection. If no thread is free, then it will sit
                    in the queue until some thread comes for it.</li>
                <li>The worker thread receives the HTTP request from client and returns the appropriate HTTP response
                    and closes the connection.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="section">
            <p id="section-header">Benchmarks</p>
            <p>I included a html page full of images of puppies and a script to make a 100 requests to the server and
                time it. On my PC with an i5 processor, it takes around 4 seconds to complete. To run the benchmark yourself, in the
                root directory of this repository run <code>bash benchmark.sh</code>.
